Version 2.10.1
Re Release of the system. 

Version 2.13.0
Updated Spanish Language file. Thanks to @Nerfyon Ban Solo#3091
Updated Swedish Language file. Thanks to @Sajkiq#5977
Added optional Critical rolls as a system setting.  This is part of the Optional rules to:
On Hits - add 1d6 damage of a roll of 1 and display a critical failure message on a roll of 20 (free hit for opponent)
On Defence - display a critical Success message on a roll of 1 (free hit for character) and display a critical failure message on a roll of 20 (+3 Damage)
See page 179 of the core rulebook for further details. 

Thanks to @khaali#8262: 
Controlling attributes for Initiative and Defence are now selectable.  
Added Qualities tab to Weapons with checkboxes for each quality. 
Currently these do not add modifiers but will enable those changes in the future.   
The existing Quality text field on the Stats tab still controls what appears on the character sheet. 

Version 2.13.1
Corrected issue where Boons were being shown as Bane on the Character sheet.
Updated Swedish language pack. Thanks to @Sajkiq#5977 
Chat message adjustments (font size and boldness). Thanks to @Sajkiq#5977

Version 2.14.0
With Thanks to @khaali#8262 :
Changed artifact sheet. An artifact always has several powers, usually 2 or 3, each with its specific status (active, passive, reactive...) and its specific corruption gain. 
Added 3 power tabs, with 3 power descriptions, active status, and corruption gain.
Added a field 'number' on equipment and weapons, in order to keep track of consumables. 

With thanks to @Bithir#2454 :
Typo Impending -> Impeding
Bonus to stats was not taken into consideration when calculating toughness, corruption threshold and abomination, and defence.

My bit:
Updated Character and Monster sheets Gear tab to display new Artifact format and the equipment quantity field.
